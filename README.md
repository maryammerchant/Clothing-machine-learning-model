# Clothing-machine-learning-model

# Abstract:

The purpose of this project was to develop a way to quantitatively measure correct sizing of
garments among consumers in the domain of online shopping. Using a data set collected from
Kaggle of 100,000 different users and their clothing sizes in relation to three factors identified as
the final set of scale. The factors included height, weight, and age of a user which would be used
to train our model which would output the correct sizing needed by each user.

# Conclusion:
One way to improve the accuracy of this model would be to add data with more specific measurement
features like bust size, waist size, and hip size. These factors impact fit and by training our model with
these measurements we will be able to provide more accurate sizes.

In order to for online operations and ensure customer satisfaction and increase effectiveness, retailers
need to address concerns with fit and sizing. Therefore, the product I created is especially important
to improve the quality of merchandising related to fit and size and the way they display this information
for consumers at their online stores.
